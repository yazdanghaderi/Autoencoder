# Autoencoder
an example of Autoencoder to Feature Extraction for Classification and compare results of raw data and encoder output for fitting to neural network.
autoencoder network is trained in AutoEncoder_Classifier.py file and save weights of network in encoder.h5. then we can use that to a simple classification in reterive_encoder_result_by_another_classifier.py file.
